      <h2> Research Questions</h2>
    
        <h3>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
        <p>Definetly the audiovisual effect being produced by the mouse movement.</p>
        <h3>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
        <p>
        <ul> 
            <li>Changing the parameters</li>
            <li>Adjusting my computers volume</li>
            <li>Pressing the speaker button</li>
            <li>Trying refraction/reverb</li>
            <li>Isolating certain params by making others zero</li>
        </ul>  
        </p>
        <h3>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
        <p>Altering and and observing the different ways of manipulating the audible and visible action surrounding the cursor and its motion.</p>
        <h3>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
        <p> The most common action was moving the cursor around and listening to see if the volume and tempo of the sound being made would remain constant if didn't stop moving the cursor that way.</p>
        <h3>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
          <p>Probably to let people play and then try to understand what it is they're controlling.</p> 
        <!-- <p>The goal of this experience appears to be "Audio-Visual Synthesis". In the footer of the page we can see this term; however, there is no sound emitted from this page. Ton of the average person's surface level understanding of the word "audio" or "sound". We can see in the controls panel that most of the controls have two names, audio and visual terms are presented as synonyms. This leads me to believe that the cursor's visual effect is not merely visual but is actually audio represented visually. Off the top of my head, I wanted to say that "visually audible" is an oxymoron, but upon reflection the visual and the audible are inherently interrelated. Perhaps the goal is to confront how people think about the relationship of the visual and the audible.</p> -->
        <h3>6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
        <p>Through the complexity of the change in the audiovisual sythesis when manipulating each parametre; using terminology that the average person wouldn't have a clear understanding makes this more challenging. E.g., entropy param is perhaps the most confusing as users would try to understand it same as the other params but as entropy (in this case) refers to the randomness level of liquid molecules, a user wouldn't be able to deduct what this param does without knowing the definition of the word.  </p>
        <h3>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
        <p>I believe the variety of controls are meant to encourage the user to experiment or play with the audiovisual difference between different param value combinations. Initially, one may try to understand the effect of each control, seperately; it may take 1 minute. Then users may try to understand the audiovisual effect different controls have on eachother when used in combination; this may take 2 minutes. Finally the manipulation of different levels of each control, it's a complete mess hard to follow; likely entertains for about 1 minute more.</p>
        <h3>8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
        <p>The footer tells us to open controls to adjust parametres and has a speaker icon that has 3 modes (full volume, medium-low volume, and mute). After playing with the controls the experience can be reset or have reverb turned on which may then lead the user to start playing with the params all over again. I don't believe there is any objective or end to the experience so it's likely intended to be used as long as one finds it entertaining, which will vary. </p>
        <h3>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
        <p>Image, Text and audio.</p>
        <h3>10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        <p>Presuming the reference is talking about </p>
        <!-- <p>In searching for a way of turning on the sound that is supposedly playing the user inevitably gives up; at this point users must resort to other explanations, coming from the controls labels as discussed earlier. The user should be flexible and openminded, not bound by their prior understandings of web icons and the audio-visual.</p> --> 
        <h3>11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        <p>.</p>
        <h3>12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
        <p>Spending too long trying to hear what can't be heard.</p>
        <h3>13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
        <p>Realising how we're meant to interpret the presence of audio/sound in this experience is through the visual effect on the cursor.</p>
