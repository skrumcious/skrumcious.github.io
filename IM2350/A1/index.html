      <h2> Research Questions</h2>
    
        <h3>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
        <p>Definetly the interaction between the movement of the mouse and the visual effect it had on the area it hovered over.</p>
        <h3>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
        <p>
        <ul> 
          
        </ul>  
        </p>
        <h3>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
        <p>Altering and and observing the different ways of manipulating the distortion effect surrounding the cursor.</p>
        <h3>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
        <p> The most common action was moving the mouse in cirlces.</p>
        <h3>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
        <p> The goal of this experience appears to be "Audio-Visual Synthesis". In the footer of the page we can see this term; however, there is no sound emitted from this page. Ton of the average person's surface level understanding of the word "audio" or "sound". We can see in the controls panel that most of the controls have two names, audio and visual terms are presented as synonyms. This leads me to believe that the cursor's visual effect is not merely visual but is actually audio represented visually. Off the top of my head, I wanted to say that "visually audible" is an oxymoron, but upon reflection the visual and the audible are inherently interrelated. Perhaps the goal is to confront how people think about the relationship of the visual and the audible.</p>
        <h3>6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
        <p> </p>
        <h3>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
        <p>I believe the variety of controls are meant to encourage the user to experiment or play with the visible difference between diffence control value combinations. Initially, one may try to understand the effect of each control, seperately; it may take 1 minute. Then users may try to understand the visual effect different controls have on eachother when used in combination; this may take 2 minutes. Finally the manipulation of different levels of each control, it's a complete mess hard to follow; likely entertains for about 1 minute more.</p>
        <h3>8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
        <p>The footer tells us to open controls to adjust parametres and has a speaker icon that has 3 modes (full volume, medium-low volume, and mute). The creator may want the user to try and search for a way to hear this audio that they're being told is playing, to come to the conclusion that there is no audible audio and a reminder of the link between audio and the visual. </p>
        <h3>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
        <p>Text and allegedly audio.</p>
        <h3>10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        <p>In searching for a way of turning on the sound that is supposedly playing the user inevitably gives up; at this point users must resort to other explanations, coming from the controls labels as discussed earlier. The user should be flexible and openminded, not bound by their prior understandings of web icons and the audio-visual.</p>
        <h3>11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        <p>It makes you feel confused and intrigued.</p>
        <h3>12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
        <p>Spending too long trying to hear what can't be heard.</p>
        <h3>13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
        <p>Realising how we're meant to interpret the presence of audio/sound in this experience is through the visual effect on the cursor.</p>
